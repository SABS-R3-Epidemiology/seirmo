The SEIR model is a model of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). It assigns a population into 4 groups, which are Susceptible(S), Exposed(E), Infectious(I) and Recovered(R). In this model, individuals will transit from being Susceptible to Exposed, from Exposed to Infectious and from Infectious to Recovered. To control the rate at which the individuals transit from one state to the other, some parameters are imposed in the model.
  
The model is characterised by few constants, which include the *reproduction number*, the *incubation period* and the *infection period*. The *reproduction number* measures the number of infected cases originating from primary infections, the *incubation period* defines the average period of time for exposed individuals to become infectious, and the *infection period* is the average period of time for infected patients to recover from the disease.  
  
The system of ODEs is solved to retrieve the number of individuals in each S, E, I and R group. The incidence number is then inferred from the solution. To solve the system of ODEs, the initial value of each group is required. Different initial values will give different solutions.
